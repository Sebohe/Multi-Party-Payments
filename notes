GENERAL

The default account needs to be unlocked or you need to specifiy with which account you will use to deploy. What I did was eliminate the other account that had no balance so that the node would default to the one i was already unlocking


JS
To read a file and save it to variable input

fs = require('fs')
fs.readFile(file, 'utf8', function(err, data){if (err){return console.log(err);} input = data ;});
